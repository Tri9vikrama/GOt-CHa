“what's your favorite zef?”

I feel like I have to try to justify my interest here, because I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm trying to learn to work with semantic web design, mostly thus far with Referata wikiing. However, I like the quality of bibliography work that IFLA has done, and in researching some of their stuff online, I came across the RDA Registry’s GitHub site. I find GitHub to be very interesting, and am experimenting with how version control could maybe help me in my efforts to learn and produce RDFa and who knows, on from there.

I might be slow, but I hope GitHub will let me stay here a while as I learn. It seems like a possibility, and all I'm really trying to do is mind my own business, mostly, while learning a little bit here and there from what others are doing who know much better. Thanks.
